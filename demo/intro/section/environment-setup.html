    <h3>Laying a foundation</h3>
    <em>TODO: Explain how the foundation is the true basics like: setting up a git repo, adding a basic README, setting up basic folders, and creating an install script for basic tools</em>
    <p>
      You are never benefitted from waiting to lay your foundation. Your foundation consists of the most important thing to every codebase, the code itself. To get a tangible feeling on the code, what a developer does is they make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)">source control repository</a>.
      Now there are a few different options out there for source control:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      In my professional career, I have used subversion and git. I have never witnessed a mercurial repo, but know that they are famously used at companies like Facebook and Google. 
      <br>
      There is not one end-all be-all solution for version control, but use whatever is most available to the context you are working in. In the end, they are going to be doing the same thing, and it is more important to initially maintain a general understanding of all things around you.
      <br>
      I speak more about my philosophy of general understanding over <a href="/blog/understanding">here on the Edu blog</a>.
      <br>
      For each version control solution, you have a choice of different ways to interact with it. I will give you my personal experience with these choices for source control, and my honest opinion on their merits.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Git
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">The official git client</a> from the git project, source code available <a href="https://github.com/git/git">here</a>.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Subversion (mostly usable on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>)
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://tortoisesvn.net">TortoiseSVN</a> is the only client I ever used or was made aware of before making this course</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients">Comparison of clients</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mercurial
          <ul>
            <li>I have no idea and if you find yourself using Mercurial, something else is likely wrong already.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      I think the point may have already come across, but I don't generally think of using Subversion or Mercurial for source control management. I have heard of their being merits to these systems in specific cases.
      If you consider these are entirely different tools, the assumption tracks and you won't be surprised to learn that this is because <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-vs-svn-what-difference">they're designed entirely differently</a>.
      <br /><br />
      tl;dr
      <ul>
        <li>
          Git allows the developer to work locally without network connection. You hold a copy of the repo state on your local computer, and occasionally synchronize with the centralize git server when "pushing" changes
        </li>
        <li>
          Subversion requires that any source control operations you perform be negotiated and handled by the centralized svn server, following a centralized client-server model:
