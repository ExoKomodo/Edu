    What is a computer really?
    <p>
      This may seem unnecessary, but it is necessary to understand, in the simplest of terms, what makes a computer.
      It may be genuinely surprising to look back and see that the first computers were not even electronic, but then
      again, consider how you would make a computer from scratch? But wait! I have yet to tell you what a computer even
      is! So it may be best that we take a different approach, and instead see what compelled the creation of computers
      in the first place, and how the people working on those problems came to designing "computers".
