      Welcome to the free intro course of Edu!
      <br /><br />
      Our intention for this course is to give an idea of what Edu has to offer beyond your typical non-collegiate learning experience with programming.
      <br /><br />
      Many bootcamps overemphasize how to work with specific languages and tooling, spending the majority of your paid time on how to use a library, such as <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">React</a>.
      <br /><br />
      Does it ever feel like you are always behind though? Facing an insurmountable mountain of new libraries, frameworks, or the Next new Nuxt? I cann tell you this,

      There exists a place for specialists in the programming discipline, but this relies on the strength of a firm foundation of understanding in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>.
      <br /><br />
      Yes, you just got linked to a <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> article in this course. If crowd-sourced data is acceptable for enterprise software, then crowd-sourced data is acceptable to assist in this journey.
      <br /><br />
      The journey Edu wants to start you on is that of making you into a software craftsman, and that will take learning how to use whatever resources are available in your given situation.

      It is our hope that this free course be a valuable resource to all developers, regardless the stage in their software development career. From this course, you may be equipped to start an autodidactic journey. You may desire more guidance and structure to accelerate the process, and that is what Edu's paid course offering provides.
      <br /><br />
      Sit down on a rock somewhere. Find a coffee shop. Nestle into your gamer den. Go to wherever your cognition functions best, and Edu sincerely hopes to bring something of value to your education.
