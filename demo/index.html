      <h4>Why is Edu here?</h4>
      <p>
        <br />
        Our intention for this course is to give an idea of the quality of what Edu has to offer you, beyond your typical non-collegiate learning experience with programming.
        <br /><br />
        Block out a few hours, sit down, open up an IDE, maybe work on approaching the <a href="https://xkcd.com/323/">Ballmer Peak</a>, and decide if Edu should be a next step.
