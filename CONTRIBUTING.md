# Contributing

First off, thanks for wishing to contribute to ExoKomodo's educational extravaganza!

Not only will this benefit the Edu community, but contributing to a structured open-source project will expose you to the disciplines of software development and prepare you for doing work in the professional world

## Creating an Issue

Before you start fixing problems or adding value to Edu, it may be at your behest to find something to complain about first!

Loads of issues have likely been filed before you show up, but now is your opportunity to submit your request to the proverbial complaint box

Existing templates for issues are present so you can create an issue in a guided manner, and using one is as simple as [going here](https://github.com/ExoKomodo/Edu/issues/new/choose)

## Fixing an issue

If you wish to take an issue, there are two different routes to take depending on your role in the site's development:

1. If you are a part of the official [teams](https://github.com/orgs/ExoKomodo/teams) of [ExoKomodo](https://github.com/orgs/ExoKomodo), then assign yourself to the issue
1. If you are not a part of the teams (such as a user of Edu), then write a comment on an unassigned issue saying you will be attempting to resolve the issue

From this point on, I will provide instructions separately, based on which role you play in the previous step, as a team member or a user helping out

## Creating a branch

### Team member

I cannot stress this enough, but **DO NOT USE A [FORK](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)**

Forks are frustrating to work with, as they are:
- difficult to know what is actually being worked on
- difficult to keep in-sync

### Helpful user

I am sad to say, you must use a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

A fork is a total copy of this repository's branches, but nested under your user namespace

For example, James Orson has a fork of Edu under [his namespace](https://github.com/JamesOrson/Edu)

Now you can push to the `main` branch of your fork directly and not clobber anything on the actual [Edu repo](https://github.com/ExoKomodo/Edu)


## Syncing changes from main

### Team member

Say the main branch is updated before you can merge your change in, no biggie

You have 2 options:
# TODO
