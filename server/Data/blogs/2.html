    So ya finished the course. Nice! Good work!
</h2>
<p>Take a victory lap and a breather. That was respectable work, and I am sure 
it nearly crushed you.  I'm also sure that you were told you'd be employable
afterwards, and depending on your background, you may think that the piece 
of paper will get you the mileage you need in this career field.
Well, I hate to break it to you, but every hiring manager I've spoken to 
since late 2022 has absolutely no interest in hiring bootcamp grads. 
In fact, I've spoken to more people who have company policy against this 
than people who are willing to discuss. And that leaves you, my dear friend,
in a pickle. What are you going to do? Will you give up? Or will you learn 
to teach yourself, to feed yourself, to become independent, and prove the 
naysayers wrong? Every employer wants an employee that learns to deal with 
their problems without being spoon fed. Unfortunately, it's a tough status 
to achieve without a little guidance.
</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Which is where I am stepping in.</h2>
<p>I am in the process of building out a full set of courses with the goal of 
moving people from the 'bootcamp grad' status to the world beyond, to having
pride in their own work, to generating their own code from scratch, and 
having the confidence to say, 'I KNOW HOW TO CODE.' When I graduated two 
years ago, I had some confidence, but not a lot, and I had experience 
before I even started. So I can't imagine the average graduate feels good 
about their work, or that the curriculum did what it was supposed to; I 
can't imagine the average graduate feels like they paid $15,000 for a 
little more than what a youtube series would have taught them; and I'm 
gonna guess that, like me, most graduates at bootcamps are feeling a 
little sheepish, and extremely nervous about the whole process. </p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">So I am working to fix this. </h2>
<p>I want every bootcamp grad to get a job. I really do. And I really want each 
student to continue to grow, as they are told to, after they graduate. The 
problem is that most graduates are applying to jobs full-time, and they have 
discontinued their growth! They fall out of love with coding as fast as they 
fell in love with it, and we can't have that. Coding is beautiful! It's fun! 
It's a massive headache! It's the best of times and the worst of times!</p>
<h2>So here is my big fat To-Do list, curated for the bootcamp graduate 
extraordinaire, or ordinaire, whichever one suits you.</h2>
<p>First thing: I am assuming you have taken some full-stack coding coursework, 
and have worked with JavaScript and Python. I am also assuming you would 
like to work with full-stack tech; if not, try focusing on parallel or 
tangential technologies to the thing you want to learn. But if you want to 
understand the big picture of fullstack, my first recommendation would be to
learn TypeScript. It writes very similarly to JavaScript (it is a 'superset!'), 
but it adds some clarifications. I also recommend watching Fireship “____ in 100
seconds” on YouTube for every topic you are planning to learn; his channel does
a great job of giving you a 2-3 minute broad overview of what a tech topic is.
Here's why you need TS, and the aforementioned Fireship video:</p>

<p>After learning about types, you should take an app that <strong>
    you know you have
    gotten working perfectly
</strong> and put it in a Docker container:  </p>

</a>
<br>
<p>If you'd like, feel free to try their NodeJS tutorial as well, or instead.</p>
<p>If you were confused by why you might want docker… let's take a break and 
watch through the first half of this YouTube series on computer science. 
This won't immediately 'make you a better coder', but only like 10% of 
professional work is coding anyways, and the rewards will appear down the 
road. You need to understand at a conversational level how a computer works 
and why they are the way they are; the videos on logic gates and the concept
of abstraction are both absolutely critical.</p>

<br>
<p>Try AWS via Stephane Maarek’s excelent course on Udemy. This will be 
laborious. I recommend mixing this in with other learning, taking notes, and 
potentially watching all the videos twice, and asking GPT a lot of questions as 
you go, particularly questions like ‘what is the point of an EC2’ and ‘What 
would I use EKS for at a small startup’ or similar. Try to contextualize why 
you’d use it. (The test for AWS CCP is like $100 and looks slick on a resume). 
The course goes for sale regularly; don’t pay more than $30 for it.</p>

</a>
<br>
<p>Breathe. That was a lot!</p>
<p>Harvard’s CS50 course. This is another sizeable work to go through, so feel 
free to do some smaller things in the middle here like learning GraphQL or 
picking up Vue or NextJS (if you have React experience), but CS50 is roughly
what you would want or need if you are trying to understand computer 
science without a degree. You’ll also discover that many top-tier 
universities put their coursework online for free, including MIT, Yale, 
Berkeley, Stanford, and more. Don’t bother paying for it, nobody will ever 
care, although I have mentioned this in interviews (interviewers LOVE when 
you mention things you’ve done that didn’t make it on the resume).</p>

<p>At this point you should have a decent grip on both how computers work and 
the value and use of the cloud; you should have a grip on type systems, 
containers, and learning a new technology shouldn’t be apocalyptically hard 
anymore. You’ve seen some patterns. I now recommend you try working with a 
lower-level language, like Assembly, to make an operating system. Just use a 
YouTube tutorial for this. </p>
